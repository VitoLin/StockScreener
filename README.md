Looks for popular stocks based on web forums

## About
##### This was a project I created over the summer as a way to find stocks that had gained an unexpected increase in interest. I scraped comments from certain Reddit forums in order to chart the popularity of ticker symbols throughout the month and tried to predict stocks that would get an unwarrented increase in price due to pump and dumps.
